Feature name: Exchange messages and communicate with others
As a User of the Service,
So that I can ensure no misunderstanding in communication and protect my privacy,
I want to send private message to requester/buyer only to reduce information loading
Scenario: Try to negotiate an appropriate time for receiving my requested product
Given I am on MyPage (personal customized page)
Then I should see there are tabs I can switch to “profile” page.
When I select “profile” tab
Then I should be on the profile page
When I see there is a “Mailbox” button
Then I can press the “Mailbox” button on the profile page
And I should be allowed to send private message to specified user(buyer)
