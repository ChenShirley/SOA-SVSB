Feature: Ranking yes/no
As a User of the Service [Requester]
So that I can give feedback and evaluation about a task,
I want to report if the buyer buys the requested product for me
Scenario: Try to rank the buyer
Given I am on the MyPage (personal customized page)
Then I should see "Yes" and “No” on the button of each product column
When I want to rank the buyer
And I press "yes/no" button
Then I should be still on the same page
And I should see the result of my ranking
