Feature: View my history record
As a User of the Service,
So that I can know what I have requested and bought through this service,
I want to check out my personal history record
Scenario: Try to find what kind of products I have bought and requested
Given I am on MyPage (personal customized page)
Then I should see there are tabs I can switch to “history” page.
When I select “history” tab
Then I should be on the history page
And I should see there’re list showing all my requested and bought products
